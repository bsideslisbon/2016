# 300 - Elliot's Diary
## What is the class?

In Mr. Robot season 2, Elliot used a personal Journal or Diary where we would write his thoughts.

If you googled "mr robot diary" you would find out that this same diary is being commercialized as an actual book.

Going to Amazon and using the Look Inside of the book you would be able to view the first pages of the book.

On the first page, that is a Schedule, on the Class placeholder you would find the sentence: "the world forever."

flag: theworldforever.
