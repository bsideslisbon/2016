# 200 - Party
## What I learned with DJ Mobley?

In Mr. Robot, Sunil Markesh was fan of a DJ called Mobley, from whom he took his hacker name.

After the 5/9 hack, Mobley DJs the End of The World Party at the arcade. If you remember there was a flyer of that party.

If you googled "dj mobley mr robot" and looked at the images, you would find the image of the flyer that already made it's way into tshirts.

You can read this following sentence on the flyer:

"Or How I Stopped Worrying And Learned To Love F Society"

flag: tolovefsociety
